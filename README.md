## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Ensure you have **Python 3.12** or newer installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate into the project directory
cd inventa_backend

# Create a virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Setup

The project requires environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root and include the following:

```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///inventory.db
```

- **FLASK_APP**: Specifies the main Flask application file.
- **FLASK_ENV**: Set to `development` for debugging purposes.
- **SECRET_KEY**: A random secret key for secure sessions.
- **DATABASE_URL**: The URL for the database connection (using SQLite in this example).

## Running the Application

Once you have set up your environment variables, initialize the database and start the application:

```bash
# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade

# Run the Flask application
flask run --port=5555
```

The application will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5555`.
